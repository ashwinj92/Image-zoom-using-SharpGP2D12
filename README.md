Serial Communication between laptop computer and Atmega 328 based controller(Arduino bootloaded) using the on board UART of the arduino and the laptops serial port.


This program is used to demonstrate how proximity sensing can be used inorder to zoom in or zoom out image with respect
to the center of the image calculated by

center(x,y)=(width/2,height/2)

This is just one example implemation 
More complex stuff can be implemented starting with this program.
